## Description

A Ruby binding for curses, ncurses, and PDCurses.
curses is an extension library for text UI applications.

Formerly part of the Ruby standard library, [curses was removed and placed in this gem][1]
with the release of Ruby 2.1.0. (see [ruby/ruby@9c5b2fd][2])

## Install

    $ gem install curses

Requires ncurses or ncursesw (with wide character support).
On Debian based distributions, you can install it with apt:

    $ apt install libncurses5-dev

Or

    $ apt install libncursesw5-dev

On Windows, `gem install curses` will build bundled PDCurses, so you
don't need to install extra libraries.
However, if you prefer ncurses to PDCurses, specify the following option:

    > gem install curses -- --use-system-libraries

On mingw, you need DevKit to compile the extension library.

On MacOS, `ncurses` menu isn't natively supported. You can install the gem with menu support using homebrew:

    brew install ncurses
    gem install curses -- --use-system-libraries --with-ncurses-dir=/usr/local/opt/ncurses

_with `/usr/local/opt/ncurses` the path where homebrew installed ncurses on your machine_

## Documentation

See [https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/curses](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/curses).

## Developers

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies.

To compile the extension library, run `bundle exec rake compile`.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `curses.gemspec`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
